          Servings: 52 Pieces     Author: Namiko Chen


          Ingredients
               1 package gyoza wrappers [recipe], (52 sheets; use my homemade recipe)

               1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc), (for frying each batch of gyoza)¼ cup

               water, (for frying each batch of gyoza) | 0.8dl (kl. Weissweinglas)

               1 tsp sesame oil (roasted), (for frying each batch of gyoza)

          For The Gyoza Fillings
               ¾ lb ground pork

               5 oz cabbage, (2-3 leaves)

               2 green onion/scallion, (0.5 oz, 15 g)        | Lauch

               2 shiitake mushrooms

               1 clove garlic, (minced)

               1 knob ginger, (1", 2.5 cm: grated)

          For The Gyoza Filling Seasonings
               1 tsp sake, (It's to remove the unwanted smell of the meat; you can skip if you don't consume alcohol)

               1 tsp sesame oil (roasted)

               1 tsp soy sauce

               ¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)

               ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper

          For Dipping Sauce
               1 Tbsp rice vinegar

               1 Tbsp soy sauce

               ⅛ tsp la-yu (Japanese chili oil), (optional for spicy kick)


          Instructions
            1. Gather all the ingredients. Tip: After you open the gyoza wrappers, make sure to cover them under a
               damp towel or plastic wrap so they won't dry out.

          To Make Gyoza Filling
             1. Optional step: As cabbage leaves are thick and hard, we use different ways to make the cabbage
                leaves wilted. You can blanch or microwave them for a minute or two. You can also sprinkle salt to
               dehydrate the cabbage and squeeze the water out. Or you can skip the entire process altogether.

            2. Remove the core of the cabbage leaves and cut into very small pieces.




            3. Cut green onions and shiitake mushrooms into small pieces.




            4. Combine the ground meat, cabbage, green onion, and shiitake mushrooms in a large bowl.




            5. Add minced garlic and grated ginger to the bowl.

            6. Add the seasonings (1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, ¼ tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp sake, and ⅛ tsp freshly
               ground black pepper).




            7. Mix well and knead the mixture with hand until it becomes pale in color and sticky.




          To Fold Gyoza
             1. Take a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use a teaspoon to take a small
                amount of filling and put it in the center of the wrapper. Dip one finger in a bowl of water and draw a
                circle around the outer ¼” of the wrapper with your wet finger until it’s wet all around.




          ★ Folding Method 1 (Toward Center)
            1. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the center with your fingers (but don’t seal
               yet!).

            2. Using your thumb and index finger, start making a pleat about once every ¼“ on the top part of the
               wrapper from the center toward the right side, making 3-4 pleats. Tip: As you fold each pleat, press
               the folded pleat tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your other thumb and index finger.




            3. Continue with the left side of the gyoza.




            4. Press the pleats and shape the gyoza.




          ★ Folding Method 2 (Toward One Side)
            1. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling.

            2. Using your left thumb and index finger, start making a pleat about once every ¼ inch on the top part
               of the wrapper.




            3. Once you make each pleat, press it down with your right thumb and make pleats toward the left side.




            4. Continue all the way till there is no more top wrapper to pleat.




            5. Press the pleats and shape the gyoza.

Gyoza - Just One Cookbook                                                                   https://www.justonecookbook.com/gyoza/


            1. Before the filling starts to release moisture to the wrappers, cover the gyoza with plastic wrap and
               “flash freeze” them in the freezer until solid (at least outside is frozen). Make sure to layout the
               gyoza flat. Once the gyoza is solid, pack them in an airtight bag. Because you flash freeze them, gyoza
               won’t stick to each other in the bag. You can store gyoza for up to a month. When you use frozen
               gyoza, do not defrost. Cook while frozen and steam for extra 1-2 minutes.




          To Cook Gyoza
             1. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, place the gyoza
               in a single layer, flat side down in a circular shape (or place them in two columns).




            2. Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown, about 3 minutes.




            3. Add ¼ cup of water to the pan. Immediately cover with a lid and steam the gyoza for about 3
               minutes or until most of the water evaporates.




            4. Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Add 1 tsp sesame oil around the frying pan.

            5. Cook uncovered until the gyoza is nice and crisp on the bottom.




            6. Transfer to a plate and serve with dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce
               ingredients in a small plate and mix all together.




          To Store
             1. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in
               the freezer for a month.
