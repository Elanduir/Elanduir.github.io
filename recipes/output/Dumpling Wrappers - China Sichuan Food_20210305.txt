          Ingredients
               420 g all-purpose flour ,{unsifted, dip and sweep 3 cups} + more                        Print
             for dusting
               210 ml to 220ml water ,room temperature or just boiled hot water (note1) | 260 ml H20 warm
               1/2 tsp. salt ,2g

          Instructions
            1. Mix a small pinch of salt with flour, dig a hole in center and then stir the water in. Mix the flour with water with
               chop-stickers during the process so you can adjust the water amount if necessary. Then knead the dough for 8-10
               minutes with a stand mixer or by hand until the dough is almost smooth. Cover and rest for 15 minutes. Then re-
               knead the dough for 2-3 minutes so we can get a very smooth dough. Cover and continue resting for 1 hour.
            2. Dig a small hole in the center of the ball. Shape it to a large circle round. Cut so we will end up a long log.
            3. Shape the log around 3cm in diameter. Divide the long log into small dumpling dough pieces (each around 10g 17
               g). Dust each of them so they will not stick together.
            4. Before rolling out your dumpling wrappers, dust your working surface again. Take one piece of dough and press it
               to a round disc. Rotate the wrapper when moving your rolling pin. Repeat the process, rotate the wrapper-roll and
               rotate the wrapper-roll. The wrappers will have thicker center and thinner edges naturally. You can refer to this
               video for the process.
            5. This process might be quite difficult at the very beginning. Just keep trying. You will end up with perfect
               homemade dumpling wrappers.

          Recipe Notes
          Note1: We usually use cold water to make dumpling wrappers for water boiled dumplings. If you want to make steamed
          dumplings or pot stickers, you can use just boiled hot water.
          Note2: If you have extra dumpling wrappers, slightly dust each of them and freeze in air-tight bag. Next time before
          assembling, rest for around 30 minutes to 1 hour in room temperature until soften back.
