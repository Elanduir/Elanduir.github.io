          Author                  Rachel Conners


          Ingredients
               1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
               3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

               1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
               1/2 small garlic clove

               1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
               2 tablespoons milk

               1 cup 2 sticks chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes


          Instructions
                     1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix flour, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic and
                       rosemary in processor. Add butter and pulse until dough begins to come together. Add milk and pulse until it forms a
                       dough. Remove from food processor and gather dough into ball. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch
                       log, wrap with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour. Slice each log into thin rounds and transfer to a baking
                       sheet lined with parchment or a silpat. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the rounds.

                     2. Bake shortbread rounds until tops are dry and bottoms are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer shortbread
                       rounds to rack and cool completely.
