                                                    EASY SWAPS

                                                    I’m using white fish, but of course you could make it with salmon or prawns.


                                                    Swap out the tapenade for chopped destoned olives, or you could try jarred pesto.



                                                    Use any fresh tomatoes you’ve got – just chop ’em up and get ’em in the mix.
