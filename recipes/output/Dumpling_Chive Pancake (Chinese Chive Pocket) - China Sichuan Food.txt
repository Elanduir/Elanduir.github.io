                   portions. Flat the portion and roll out to thin wrappers around 15cm in diameter.

              For the filling
                1. Beat the egg in a small bowl. Heat up Â½ tablespoon cooking oil in pan and stir-fry the egg.
                   Cut the eggs into small pieces.
                 2. In a large bowl, mix chive with egg pieces and dried small shrimps. Add salt, sesame oil and
                    light soy sauce to make the filling.

              Assemble and frying
                1. Assemble the dumplings one by one.
                 2. Heat up 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in pan. Fry one side to golden-brown over slowest fire
                    and then turn them over and slow the fire to fry until both sides becomes golden brown. You
                   need to turn over several times during the process.


              Notes
                 1. You can use to make them as larger ones and then cut into small wedges before serving.
                 2. Remove the hard ends of chive and then cut the tender parts into small pieces. So please do
                   not double about the amount as we do not add meat in the filling and we will end up with 16
                   chive pockets. And each pocket consume large amount of filling. If you feel this is really too
                   much, you can reduce it to 150g or around. The dish is named as chive pocket as chive is the
                   main ingredient, not flavoring ingredient.
